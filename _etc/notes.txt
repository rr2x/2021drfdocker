>>> docker-compose down

>>> docker-compose up
--- it seems need to run twice after build..
error after building because maybe disabled windows services,
run again to initiate the container


--- wait till db is completed until:
     mysqld: ready for connections.

then try to manually save settings.py
~~ it seems you need to do a manual save of settings.py
to trigger refresh of django code



remove container:
>>> docker ps -a
>>> docker rm -f <container id>

to create a new app:

>>> docker exec -it <container id> sh
>>> python manage.py migrate
>>> python manage.py startapp users


important: if you change the serializer into using hashed passwords,
raw passwords will not calculate properly.. it expects hashed passwords

check docker container timezone:
>>> docker ps -a
>>> docker exec -it <container id> date


prefill data with fixtures:
>>> docker-compose exec admin_api sh
>>> python manage.py loaddata fixtures/permissions.json
>>> python manage.py loaddata fixtures/roles.json
>>> python manage.py loaddata fixtures/users.json   #password = password
